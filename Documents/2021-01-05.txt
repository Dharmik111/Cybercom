  My Name is Dharmik. I have create a new repository in github like a cybercom and work on that repository.

  learn ssh key generation using ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "username or email"  

  Create seperate folder of repository in pc and then create the directory of that folder using $ mkdir batman

  learn how to make clone repository in github using this command $ git clone git@github.com:chirag-cybercom/batman.git batman/
  
  using this command enter in the repository $ cd batman.

  using this command we check the repo. name and herer name is origin using this command $ git remote -v.

  fetch the origin with the repository using this command $ git fetch origin.
  
  after the $ git checkout -b batman-bike origin/main this command using for branch in repository to get branch. 

  $ git add . or $ git add file name to add file in the repository and after check the git status.
 
  after git commit to changes or what you do in commit using this command $ git commit -m "added echo in index file".

  then commit after we have to push the origin for changes using this command $ git push origin batman-bike
  
  Merge we have to work first this command $ git checkout main and then we have to fetch the origin using this commnd $ git fetch origin and merge the all branch using this command $ git merge --no-ff origin/batman-bike
and all branch will be display on the screen
